# CommonOpenGLAbstractions
c# abstractions for OpenGL using Silk.NET
# Why Does This Exist?
Currently it takes about 100 or more lines of code just to draw a simple shape onscreen. 
the goal of this is to lower that to under 50,
Therefore signifigantly lowering the barrier of entry to graphics programming.
# Usage
```cs
//Coming at 0.1
```
# Performance
as with any sort of Abstractions / Wrapper there is going to be slowdowns and other drawbacks.
On my system the example 'Hello Quad' took 95.6 MB of RAM.
the same example in Silk.NET took 92.5 MB of RAM.
